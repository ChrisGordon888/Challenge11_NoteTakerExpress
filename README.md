## User Story
As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a note-taking application:
When I open the Note Taker, I am presented with a landing page that includes a link to a notes page.
When I click on the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page that displays existing notes in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
When I enter a new note title and the note's text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
When I click on the Save icon, the new note I entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note is displayed in the right-hand column.
When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
